## Tic Tac Toe

## Learning Goals

- Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
    - DRY JavaScript
    - localStorage to persist data
    - event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

## Timeline

- Wednesday - Finish HTML skeleton and start CSS
- Thursday - Finish CSS and start JS
- Friday - work on JS functionality

- watch DEMO again
- if a square that already has a token clicked in it, it does not REPLACE the token, that person just can't click
- scrollable window!
- A timeout is used after a completed game to reset the board.
- YOU DO NOT NEED TO DISPLAY EACH INDIVIDUAL WIN BOARD. WE ONLY NEED TO SEE NUMBER OF WINS.
- No need to match colors or icons, but the overall layout should be the same. - You can get as creative as you would like with your Tic Tac Toe design!
